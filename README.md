# Interchange
Interchange is an awesome web template for a personal website.

## The idea
This homepage is 3-directional (hence the name). The user can press the arrow keys of their keyboards to navigate through the *interchange*.

The homescreen (the main view, which is the one on which one lands) features an avatar, a main headtitle (presumably your pseudonyme), and a nice blurry image in the background.

## State of development
**This is only a proof of concept for now**.
