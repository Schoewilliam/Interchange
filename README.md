# Interchange
Interchange is an awesome web template for a personal website.

## The idea
This homepage is 3-directional (hence the name). User can press the arrow keys of their keyboard to navigate through the *interchange*, or click the arrow buttons on each side of the screen.

The homescreen (the main view, which is the one on which one lands) features an avatar, a main headtitle (presumably your pseudonyme), and a nice blurry image in the background.
